## Introduction
Hey visitors🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️, welcome to GSA🧙‍♂️!
I hope someone never stole your car. By the way, GSA is an app that allows you to sleep peacefully.
When you left the car, activate our device and go whenever you want. At any time you can watch realtime car position within a map. If, unfortunately, your car is getting stolen our device calls you and you can monitor his movements. GSA monitor car speed,location and predict his direction! 🤩🤩🤩
So, what you are waiting for? Join to our family 🚗🔒

This repo contains 2 folder:
- main, which contains the code to build and deploy the data pipeline 
- esp, which contains the code and configuration needed by ESP32

Follow their readme files to be part of GAS 🧬
